# **Othello: Iago's Manipulation and Othello's Reaction**
IAGO: </br>
Be not acknown on ’t.</br>
I have use for it. Go, leave me.</br>
_(==Emilia=={Q5371628} exits.)_</br>
I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin</br>
And let him find it. Trifles light as air</br>
Are to the jealous confirmations strong</br>
As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.</br>
The Moor already changes with my poison;</br>
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,</br>
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</br>
But with a little act upon the blood</br>
Burn like the mines of sulfur.</br>
</br>
_(Enter ==Othello=={Q1966171}.)_</br>
</br>
I did say so.</br>
Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora</br>
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world</br>
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</br>
Which thou owedst yesterday.</br>
OTHELLO:</br>
Ha, ha, false to me?</br>
IAGO:</br>
Why, how now, general? No more of that!</br>
OTHELLO:</br>
Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.</br>
I swear ’tis better to be much abused</br>
Than but to know ’t a little.</br>
IAGO:</br>
How now, my lord?</br>
OTHELLO:</br>
What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?</br>
I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.</br>
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and</br>
merry.</br>
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.</br>
He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,</br>
Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.</br>
IAGO  I am sorry to hear this.</br>
OTHELLO:</br>
I had been happy if the general camp,</br>
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,</br>
So I had nothing known. O, now, forever</br>
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!</br>
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars</br>
That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!</br>
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,</br>
The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,</br>
The royal banner, and all quality,</br>
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</br>
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats</br>
Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,</br>
Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!</br>
IAGO:</br>
Is ’t possible, my lord?</br>
OTHELLO:</br>
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!</br>
Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,</br>
Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,</br>
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</br>
Than answer my waked wrath.</br>
IAGO:
Is ’t come to this?</br>
OTHELLO:
Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it</br>
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop</br>
To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!</br>
